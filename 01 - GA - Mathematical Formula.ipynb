Then, some members of the population found the global maximum and we stayed at that maximum for the rest of the trial.  By generation 30, the median value was near the global optimum and we see major convergence in the later generations.  Despite this, the mean value fluctuates significantly, indicating that a decent segment of the population provided us with miserable scores.  The **best** members of a genetic algorithm population tend to be good, but that doesn't mean that **all** members will be equally good.\n",
