This is demo code for my talk entitled Genetics In Action:  Evolutionary Algorithms.  You can see the presentation at http://csmore.info/on/gia.

## Requirements

The demos are a set of notebooks running the R programming language. I used [R version 4.4.1](https://cran.rstudio.com/bin/windows/base/) and [RStudio Desktop](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/) to run these.
